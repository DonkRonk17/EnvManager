## 1. EnvManager - Title Card

**Filename:** `EnvManager_titlecard.png`

**Prompt:**
```
Create a Beacon HQ family title card for EnvManager: Cross-platform environment and service manager with env vars, systemd/Docker control, and profile switching - zero dependencies.

Cinematic 16:9 format (3840×2160). Central logo-style wordmark "EnvManager" integrating environment/system management symbolism (stylized gear meshes, layered environment switches, service control icons).

Background: futuristic eco-tech environment inspired by Beacon HQ, with photonic circuitry lines and premium materials. Minimal, cinematic, ultra-realistic, crisp edges, tasteful glow, no extra text beyond "EnvManager".

Style DNA: Deep glass blues, cool whites, subtle teal glow, natural greens. Micro-etched glass, brushed metal, luminous circuit filaments, clean eco landscaping. Subtle photonic border or corner rails.

Constraints: No watermarks, no random words, no extra logos, no clutter, no cartoon style, no distorted geometry. CPUs are rare accents only (1-3 small embedded motifs max, never the main subject).

## 2. EnvManager - Logo Mark (1:1)

**Filename:** `EnvManager_logo_1x1.png`

**Prompt:**
```
Design a Beacon HQ family logo mark for EnvManager: a simple, high-recognition symbol of environment/service management (stylized layered environment icon, gear/switch hybrid, control panel symbol), using Beacon HQ materials and photonic linework.

Clean silhouette, readable at small sizes, optional "EnvManager" wordmark variant below or beside the symbol, no extra text.

Dimensions: Primary 1:1 (2048×2048).

Style DNA: Deep glass blues, cool whites, subtle teal glow. Micro-etched glass, brushed metal, luminous circuit accents. Ultra clean geometric sans typography for "EnvManager" wordmark.

Transparent background. Minimal, premium, instantly recognizable as environment/system management tool.

## 3. EnvManager - App Icon

**Filename:** `EnvManager_icon.png`

**Prompt:**
```
Create a 1:1 app icon for EnvManager in the Beacon HQ suite style: bold central symbol of environment management (stylized layered environment stack, gear with switches, control hub), strong contrast, safe margins, minimal detail that still feels premium, photonic accents, eco-tech feel, no text.

Dimensions: 1024×1024 pixels with safe margins for rounded corners.

Style DNA: Deep glass blues, cool whites, subtle teal glow. Single bold symbol representing environment/service control. High legibility at small sizes (16px-512px).

Background: Subtle gradient from deep blue to teal from Beacon HQ palette. No transparency needed for icon.
